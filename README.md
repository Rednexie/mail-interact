# mailer-template
e-mail spammer template using node.js


This repository was originally an e-mail spammer, using the subscription form in the website https://pardus.org.tr. And after the vulnerability was reported by me, the website developers have quickly fixed the issue. Now this repo is an "e-mail spammer template" rather than a spammer. I can consider a collab if you have access to send e-mails either via smtp or an api.
